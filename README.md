# AdventOfCode

This repository will collect all my solutions to AdventOfCode over the years.

## Structure of this repository

- Separate commonly used utility into own projects the naming scheme for those will be ``Utility_<Lang>`` (e.g. Utility_Cpp).
- ``AoC_<Year>`` contains the entries:
  - ``Day<dd>_<Name>_<Lang>`` which always is its own project!
